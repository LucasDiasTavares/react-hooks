# Learning the basics of React Hooks

In this project I'll do a simple budget calculater, I have already done one using Django(Python), I'll try do the same thing but using React with hooks.

Deployed in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Probably this will be my first app that I'll use in my portif√≥lio.
